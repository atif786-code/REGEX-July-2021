I am a lecturer in the Standford Computer Science Department.Before coming to Standford,I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent(now part of IBM). At Taligent,I worked on places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the  places for Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecyle--- from initail product conception through the actual product lauch.
